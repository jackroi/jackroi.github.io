## Giacomo Rosin

I am an AI researcher at Ca' Foscari University of Venice, Italy.
I hold both a BSc and an MSc from Caâ€™ Foscari University of Venice,
where I developed a strong foundation in computer science and artificial
intelligence.
I am currently working on human trajectory forecasting and
generative models for graphs.
